# Scope and High Level Estimate for development of Phase 1

## Responsive Website

### Frontend Development

-   Design and development of a responsive web application using modern frontend frameworks (e.g., React.js, Angular, Vue.js).
-   Implementation of a user-friendly and accessible interface that adheres to WCAG 2.2AA standards.
-   Integration with a Content Management System (CMS) with multilingual support for easy content updates and management.
-   Implementation of lead capture forms with validation and submission mechanisms.
-   Incorporation of structured schema data and social meta tags for SEO benefits.
-   Integration of anti-spam and security controls (e.g., reCAPTCHA, HTTPS).
-   Implementation of responsive design principles to ensure optimal user experience across devices and screen sizes.

### Backend Integration
-   Development of backend APIs to support frontend functionality (e.g., user authentication, data retrieval).
-   Integration with third-party systems for live data feeds and other external services.
-   Implementation of logging, diagnostics, and metrics collection to monitor application performance and support a sensible alerting strategy/

### Infrastructure and Deployment
-   Setup of cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure) to host the web application.
-   Configuration of CI/CD pipelines for automated build, test, and deployment processes.
-   Implementation of security measures (e.g., HTTPS, encryption) to protect data transmission and storage.
    
### Quality Assurance and Testing
-   Conducting thorough testing of the website across multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
-   Performing functional testing of lead capture forms, CMS integration, and API functionality.
-   Validation against WCAG 2.2AA accessibility standards.
-   Security testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Documentation and Training
-   Preparation of technical documentation outlining architecture, API specifications, and deployment procedures.
-   Provide training sessions for content managers on using the CMS effectively.

## High-Level Estimate

Based on the scope defined above, here's a high-level estimate for the development of Phase 1:

### Timeline
-   Frontend Development: Approximately 6-8 weeks
-   Backend Development and Integration: Approximately 4-6 weeks
-   Infrastructure Setup and Deployment: Approximately 1 week
-   Quality Assurance and Testing: Approximately 2-3 weeks
-   Documentation and Training: Approximately 1-2 weeks

### Total Estimated Timeline
As some of the above Timeline can be running concurrently, the project might take approximately 10-15 weeks to complete
    
### Total Hours Estimation
Roughly 500-700 hours
    
### HR Allocation
-   Frontend Developers: 2-3 developers
-   Backend Developers: 1-2 developers
-   Quality Assurance/Testers: 1 QA engineer
-   DevOps/Infrastructure: 1 specialist / Tech Lead / Director
-   Project Management: 1 project manager
    
### Assumptions
Timeline to delivery assumes that the client or 3rd party decisions and confirmations are to be made promptly. Time to launch would also depend on the quality or minimum amount of content that can be shown on the website.
